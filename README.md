## Introduction

This project implements an email detection system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Specifically, LSTM is used,. The model is trained on the spam-mails-dataset and I've explored the results with or without DropOut, FC and also without letting it reach %100 Accuracy on training dataset.

## Dataset

The [spam-mails-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset) consists of variety of emails.
