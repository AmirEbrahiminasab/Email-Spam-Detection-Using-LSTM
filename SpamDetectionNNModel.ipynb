one quarter section spacing ( 160\\r\\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\\r\\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\\r\\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\\r\\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\\r\\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\\r\\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\\r\\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\\r\\ngeological discussion\\r\\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\\r\\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\\r\\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\\r\\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\\r\\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\\r\\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\\r\\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable\\r\\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\\r\\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\\r\\nproduction facilities discussion\\r\\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\\r\\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\\r\\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\\r\\nconstructed .\\r\\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\\r\\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\\r\\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\\r\\napproximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,\\r\\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in\\r\\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\\r\\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\\r\\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\\r\\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\\r\\noil product to the transportation system .\\r\\nfor more detailed project description please see news release dated\\r\\n( fri , apr 29 ) .\\r\\ngood luck and successfu | trading .\\r\\nconclusion :\\r\\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\\r\\ncompanies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ;

this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader \\' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .\\r\\nin order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected .\\r\\nplease note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .\\r\\nrestricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader \\' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .\\r\\nin order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed as restricted top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the \" restricted top of stack \" feature .\\r\\nadvanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the \" all \" option from the drop down box .\\r\\nwebsite changes\\r\\nnew submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .\\r\\nthe submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .\\r\\nprice of limit orders\\r\\nmodify limit orders\\r\\ncustomers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the \" today \\' s orders \" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the \" set \" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .\\r\\nexpiration time for limit orders\\r\\ncustomers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .\\r\\nfloat the today \\' s orders section\\r\\nyou can now float the \" limit order \" section . in order to do so , right click in the \" today \\' s orders \" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window \" stay on top \" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option .\\r\\nmid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount .\\r\\nin order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group .\\r\\nchanges to website passwords -

              " \"Subject: northern natural gas\\r\\nyesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .\\r\\nthe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .\\r\\nwe want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .\\r\\nken\\r\\ndear ets colleague :\\r\\non thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .\\r\\nin this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .\\r\\nthe company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .\\r\\nbeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .\\r\\nover many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !\\r\\nstan\",\n",

( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf\\r\\ndear shareholder , addlrko\\r\\ni am writing to you today to\\r\\ndiscuss the new direction which your company will be\\r\\nheading . up until this point we made it clear that\\r\\nabdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of\\r\\nthe market . our basic premise was to seek out\\r\\ncompanies that can be turned into positive cash flow\\r\\nbusinesses with the proper equity investment made into\\r\\nthem by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;\\r\\nwith a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we\\r\\nexpect fine wein to be able to throw off significant\\r\\npositive cash flow over the next 12 months from the\\r\\nvarious projects they are currently working on .\\r\\ne - direct is another example ; we should start to see\\r\\nsome meaningful positive cash flow developing and\\r\\ncontinuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has\\r\\nnot maintained a particular industry focus . as of\\r\\ntoday that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir\\r\\nlast week we announced that abdv\\r\\nwill be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to\\r\\nfuture quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,\\r\\na company in the oil gas sector , this was the start\\r\\nof our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in\\r\\nlocating and provide managerial , accounting and\\r\\nfinancing for companies in the energy field , from oil\\r\\nand gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft\\r\\nyou may ask ; why the energy\\r\\nrelated field ? simply it currently offers many\\r\\nopportunities and with the price of oil approaching\\r\\n$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth\\r\\nto be made in this sector . according to adjusted\\r\\ninflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak\\r\\nof $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis\\r\\nof the past , we are looking at what will be a problem\\r\\nto stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand\\r\\nfor oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this\\r\\nyear alone , most of which is because of china . the\\r\\nincrease in oil prices is not a fade which once the\\r\\nbubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30\\r\\nlevel . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented\\r\\nin stone . there are more players in the world economy\\r\\ntoday that require oil gas to propel their own\\r\\neconomies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at\\r\\nthese higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself\\r\\nwith individuals that have experience in the energy\\r\\nfield . these individuals will help locate viable\\r\\nopportunities and the funding necessary to participate\\r\\nin these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira\\r\\nso what do we do with our\\r\\nnon - energy related businesses such as fine wein\\r\\nrecords and e - direct ? well , first of all we will\\r\\ncontinue to incubate and nurture these businesses\\r\\nuntil they are at a level where they can move on their\\r\\nown . i believe that both of these companies will be\\r\\nstrong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at\\r\\nthat point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of\\r\\ndirectors that we spin - off these two businesses to our\\r\\nshareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the\\r\\nbasic premise of our business module whereby we share\\r\\nthe wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing\\r\\npublic our portfolio companies . we can then continue\\r\\nto concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw\\r\\nby concentrating on a specific\\r\\nsector such as the energy area we will be able to\\r\\ndefine abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our\\r\\ngoal will be to locate and make investments in no less\\r\\nthan four energy - related businesses over the next 12\\r\\nmonths . i believe that by maintaining this focus an\\r\\ninvestment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative\\r\\nway to participate in the booming oil gas and\\r\\nenergy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm\\r\\nfine wein records , inc .\\r\\nannounces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo\\r\\nfine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development\\r\\ncorporation , inc .

p\\r\\nas many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in\\r\\nprice because they are promoted , making a very large number of\\r\\ninvestors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp\\r\\nlet ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\\r\\notc : dmxpp\\r\\nabout the company : p\\r\\ndelta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\\r\\ncompany that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\\r\\n( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\\r\\nlocated over what management considers to be some of the most\\r\\nprospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\\r\\nanother 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\\r\\ncontrolled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\\r\\nthat the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\\r\\nfound in north america . p\\r\\nthe management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\\r\\nrayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\\r\\ncompany to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\\r\\nexperience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\\r\\nmost successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\\r\\nthe president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\\r\\nmarket cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\\r\\nwith glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\\r\\nminerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\\r\\nalong with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\\r\\nextraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\\r\\nmoves forward . p\\r\\namong the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\\r\\nyears experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\\r\\nsouth america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\\r\\ncorp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\\r\\ndrilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\\r\\ndelta has experienced significant technical success since its\\r\\nstart - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\\r\\nin - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\\r\\nkimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\\r\\nof the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\\r\\nthe three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\\r\\nminerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\\r\\ndiamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\\r\\nan aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\\r\\ndiscover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\\r\\nunder - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\\r\\nkimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\\r\\nin bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\\r\\nprospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\\r\\ngroup of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\\r\\none - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\\r\\nthe independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\\r\\ncomprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\\r\\nall the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\\r\\nexploration is justified . p\\r\\ndelta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\\r\\nits extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\\r\\nby acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\\r\\nidentifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\\r\\ncompanies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\\r\\nfinance additional exploration . p\\r\\nin addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\\r\\ncontrols , they also control a gold property with great potential .\\r\\nthe property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\\r\\nrevealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\\r\\nextensive exploration program . pp\\r\\n( source : company website ) p\\r\\nrecent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p\\r\\ndelta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a\\r\\nconference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p\\r\\ndelta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in\\r\\npreparation of work program . p\\r\\ndelta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold\\r\\nexploration findings in south america . p\\r\\ndelta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond\\r\\nexploration in south america . pp\\r\\nwill dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of\\r\\nthe stock this weekend and next week ?

              " 'Subject: new version of stack manager\\r\\nintroduction\\r\\nin response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have\\r\\nupgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we\\r\\nhope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your\\r\\nproducts .\\r\\nthis new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .\\r\\nplease ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .\\r\\nsummary of new features\\r\\nmultiple children - a \" child \" product can be the \" parent \" of another child\\r\\n( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed\\r\\nagainst a single parent .\\r\\nstatic product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and\\r\\nhit the \" + \" or \" - \" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount\\r\\nin product properties until you logout .\\r\\nsorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on\\r\\nthe title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your \" shift \" key .\\r\\nparent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis\\r\\nrelationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : \" basis\\r\\nlink - parent \" and now would say \" stand alone , parent \" ) .\\r\\ndetailed feature descriptions\\r\\nmultiple children\\r\\nthe new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together\\r\\nin a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product\\r\\nb , which is in turn linked to parent product c .\\r\\nwarning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a\\r\\nchain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a\\r\\ncustomer attempts a transaction , the database must \" lock \" each and every\\r\\nproduct in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the\\r\\ndatabase must then update the stack for each product before releasing the\\r\\nlocks . \" vertical \" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are\\r\\nmuch slower to process than \" flat \" chains ( one parent with many children ) .\\r\\nlarge vertical chains should be avoided .\\r\\nrelated to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the\\r\\nsame parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent\\r\\nproduct b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link\\r\\nto the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated\\r\\nbasis link and a regular basis link .\\r\\nstatic product bar prices\\r\\nthe new version of enrononline provides for \" sticky \" product bar price and\\r\\nvolume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not\\r\\nreset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you\\r\\nhave logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or\\r\\noffsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the \" + \" or \" - \" buttons .\\r\\none of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it\\r\\nreduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if\\r\\nthe price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price\\r\\nmovement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the\\r\\nwebsite to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder\\r\\nfor customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update\\r\\nmoves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering\\r\\nan appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price\\r\\nmovement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,\\r\\nimproving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure\\r\\nrate .\\r\\nyou may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices -

watts per hour of electricity\\r\\nfrom the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is\\r\\nthen sold to replenish the local or national grid .\\r\\nthe biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide\\r\\nneed for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a\\r\\ncorresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the\\r\\ndisposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance\\r\\nfor a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact\\r\\nthe global waste problem while a major push for generating\\r\\nelectricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot\\r\\ntopic due to shortages and massive power failures .\\r\\ngeec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with\\r\\nchinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal\\r\\nmining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300\\r\\ngeec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill\\r\\nan urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two\\r\\ncritical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3\\r\\nbillion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues ,\\r\\na shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting\\r\\nperiodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line\\r\\nto profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable\\r\\nmunicpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china\\r\\nmeet its energy needs .\\r\\nthe forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip\\r\\nof the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares\\r\\nshould be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a\\r\\ncontinuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still\\r\\nrepresent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look\\r\\nfor the continuation of strong positive developments that will\\r\\nignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the most\\r\\nexplosive gains on wall street .\\r\\ntraders ' monthly alert ( tma ) is not a registered investment\\r\\nadvisor or broker dealer . certain statements contained in this\\r\\nnewsletter may be forward -

( mogi ) to explore further opportunities in alberta canada , is an energy deveioper in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs . aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi | and gas again this morning ! montana oil and gas inc . ( mogi - news ) announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest . the company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project . symbo | - mogi current price - . 26 reasons to consider mogi : 1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul | market in a generation . 2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years . 3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets . 4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready shares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns . breaking news ! ! april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after . the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban . with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description . project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas , predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics . the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee . through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres ( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 % of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . land discussion our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480 acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160 acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units ( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well . geological discussion pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves . production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed . a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly , excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible . this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system . for more detailed project description please see news release dated ( fri , apr 29 ) . good luck and successfu | trading . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade tuesday ! go mogi . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice . \",\n",

              " 'Subject: new enrononline functionality in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below . stack manager changes top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader \\' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . in order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected . please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out . restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader \\' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . in order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed as restricted top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the \" restricted top of stack \" feature . advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the \" all \" option from the drop down box . website changes new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows . the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box . price of limit orders modify limit orders customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the \" today \\' s orders \" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the \" set \" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order . expiration time for limit orders customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours . float the today \\' s orders section you can now float the \" limit order \" section . in order to do so , right click in the \" today \\' s orders \" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window \" stay on top \" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option . mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount . in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group . changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users . please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords . if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 -

a : there are lots of things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished as \" new \" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few examples : manufacturers / distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory / country . to avoid \" disturbing \" the dealer / reseller channel in different countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the product , as new and therefore label it as refurb . most major retail superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their products and there are those consumers that just simply take advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer , inspected and repackaged like new . items where the box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the manufacturer . the item was returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested and then repackaged just like new . the item was returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that was corrected . demonstration units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are inspected , tested and repackaged . the box was simply opened . thats it ! brand new overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished . all factory refurbished products are inspected serviced by the manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product specifications . all merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer . your one stop distributorjebel ali duty free zonedubai , uae . www . computron - me . com for latest clearance sale listing contact our sales department . for further details please send your enquiries to : dealers @ emirates . net . aeor contact via www . computron - me . com compaq hewlett packard 3 com dell intel iomega epson aopen creative toshiba apc cisco us robotics microsoft canon intellinet targus viewsonic ibm sony - - - - - - - and lots more ! ! ! if you have any complaints / suggestions contact : customerservice @ computron - me . com tel + 971 4 8834464 all prices in u . s . dollars , ex - works , jebel ali duty free zone fax + 971 4 8834454 www . computron - me . com prices and availability subject to change without notice . usa - canada u . a . e . to receive our special offers in plain text format reply to this mail with the request * for export only * this email can not be considered spam as long as we include : contact information remove instructions . this message is intended for dealer and resellers only . if you have somehow gotten on this list in error , or for any other reason would like to be removed , please reply with \" remove \" in the subject line of your message . this message is being sent to you in compliance with the federal legislation for commercial e - mail ( h . r . 4176 - section 101 paragraph ( e ) ( 1 ) ( a ) and bill s . 1618 title iii passed by the 105 th u . s . congress . all logos and trademarks are the property of their respective owners products may not be exactly as shown above - - to unsubscribe from : computron 7 , just follow this link : click the link , or copy and paste the address into your browser .',\n",

( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf dear shareholder , addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading . up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market . our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ; with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the various projects they are currently working on . e - direct is another example ; we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus . as of today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) , a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial , accounting and financing for companies in the energy field , from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask ; why the energy related field ? simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching $ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector . according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this year alone , most of which is because of china . the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30 level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone . there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field . these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non - energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own . i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies . we can then continue to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy - related businesses over the next 12 months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm fine wein records , inc . announces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo fine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development corporation , inc .

( source : company website ) currently trading at . 012 p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week . pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock : p ( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5 weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in price because they are promoted , making a very large number of investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxpp about the company : p delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america . p the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward . p among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa , south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified . p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration . p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls , they also control a gold property with great potential . the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program . pp ( source : company website ) p recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in preparation of work program . p delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america . p delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond exploration in south america . pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend and next week ?

              " 'Subject: new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products . this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days . please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade . summary of new features multiple children - a \" child \" product can be the \" parent \" of another child ( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed against a single parent . static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and hit the \" + \" or \" - \" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout . sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your \" shift \" key . parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : \" basis link - parent \" and now would say \" stand alone , parent \" ) . detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product b , which is in turn linked to parent product c . warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a customer attempts a transaction , the database must \" lock \" each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks . \" vertical \" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are much slower to process than \" flat \" chains ( one parent with many children ) . large vertical chains should be avoided . related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link . static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for \" sticky \" product bar price and volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the \" + \" or \" - \" buttons . one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary , improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate . you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu . sorting / selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type , location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in alphabetical order ) . if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort criteria , plus you can select \" sort by web order \" , which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) . when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another . parent products and f / x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product . some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now identified with a stylised \" fx \" in the product list . this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent , rather than managed individually . assistance as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality , please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 ) 20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) . general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn \\' t make it into this release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .',\n",
